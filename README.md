## general presentation
A lot of students in Africa still use pen and paper to take notes during their lessons. These notes are really important as they are sometimes their only source of reference since textbooks are not easy to get. High school students, for example, go through a 4-6 year course and the notes they write in year 1 may still be relevant in year 6. Keeping a physical book for 6 years is usually not practical as books get lost, torn or spoiled by other elements. This means students have to re-write notes or look for them from other sources when they need to study for examinations. Having a cloud based note taking app ensures that students can take notes that can last a long time, that are not easily lost or spoiled, and that can be accessed anytime, anywhere. Our application will allow students to sign up and login using emails and passowrds. We will be using Firestore for Google authentication. The features of the note taking app include creating new notes, deleting notes, saving, searching, color coding, among others. The notes can be organized by category, then title. The notes can be taken offline and they will be synced to the cloud as soon as the device is connected to the internet.
